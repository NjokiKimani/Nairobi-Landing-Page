            <h3>Nairobi, the capital city of Kenya</h3>
          <div class="background">
            Nairobi’s only been a city since 1954, but it’s been making up for
            lost time ever since. The capital of Kenya is now a thriving
            metropolis that continues to grow rapidly.  While its name comes from a
            Maasai phrase meaning “the place of cool waters,” Nairobi is more
            commonly referred to as the “Green City in the Sun”. It’s a place where
            residents and wild beasts live in close proximity – and might be the
            <em>only</em> city with a safari park on its doorstep. Now one of Africa’s
            most influential cities, Nairobi is a vital commercial and financial
            regional hub, home to the regional headquarters of various major
            international companies and organizations. Its
            people, across the economic brackets, also have beautiful
            appreciation of its art that warms the heart.

            Sounds like bucket-list travel at its best, or is it? Floating high above the ground, surrounded by nothing but the , almost-always, blue sky of the cosmopolitan city, up, up, and away,  is an incredible feeling.There are several hot air balloon safari companies, but it is still advisable to pre-book this popular activity. The dry season (June to October) is the ideal time for a hot balloon safari. During the rainy months of March, April, and May, some companies will still offer tours, although actual flight will depend on the weather conditions. Thankfully, the dry season is also the perfect time to witness the Great Migration, so floating silently above this wondrous spectacle means you’re in for a treat of a lifetime.

The undivided joy of this adventure can get hair-raisingly close to 4 of the Big 5: lions, buffalos, rhinos and leopards. Nairobi National Park is adjacent to motorways, train stations, residential housing and skyscrapers of the city's skyline, yet cross into the park and you're in Kenya’s urban jungle. Until a few years ago elephants were here too, but frequent human-wildlife conflict made it necessary for their safe and continued removal from the park. But Nairobi National Park is so much more than the Big 5. The park boasts at least 80 species of animals that call this park their home. And make no mistake, Nairobi National Park isn’t a zoo, or western style safari park, this is the real thing! </p>

Every city in the world has a story – fun, interesting, or dark – and Nairobi is no exception. One of the mysteries of the city is why it’s referred to as “Nairobery”. Every traveler returns home with their own stories based on experience or speculation. If you’re keen on unlocking the mystery, join a city walking tour and wander along the alleys. You’ll uncover and understand its past and present through the eyes of those who have lived here night and day. Some of the city attractions featured include famous landmarks, museums, monuments, and old architecture. Nairobi is a place of extremes.  A city of high-end malls, colonial country clubs juxtaposed with expansive slums and village and extreme poverty.      </p>

These transit vibrant buses, known as "matatus" in Swahili, serve locals around Nairobi, and they're all just as brightly colored and fun. They fill the streets of Nairobi, Kenya, blaring music as they bounce and weave through traffic. Each matatu is louder than the next, complete with graffiti-style artwork, custom designs, flashy lights and onboard entertainment to pull the crowds. Cheap, convenient and sometimes a tad chaotic, matatus are the choice mode of transport for most Kenyans. Matatus sport diverse designs featuring hip hop artists, international pop stars, athletes, political icons and even religion. Much like rolling local radio stations, these minibuses blast homegrown music promoting up-and-coming Kenyan artists.       </p>
